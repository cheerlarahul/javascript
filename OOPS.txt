1)  Object: is a  real world entity it contain methods and properties


			Ex:  cat
			
     Properties:
	 
				Color
				
				Eyes
				
				Slin
				
				
		Methods:
		
		      
			    Walking();
				
				Running();
	   
	   
	   
2)   Class:  class is a blueprint to create a object

			


3)
	   Encapsulation: is a functionality hiding the data in a single unit
	   
	   to restict the complte properties of an object
	   
	   binding datavariables and methods into a single unit and hides from other classes
	   
	   
4)Abstraction:


			hiding the implementation details showing necessary details
			
			hiding unnecessary details from user 
			
			
			
5)Inheritence:

				acessing the properties and methods from one class to another class
				
				
				acessing parent properties to child
				
				
6) polymorphism :  many forms 


					using same method for differnt purposes 
					
					perform single action in differnt ways
					
					
Oops benfits:

				reusing of code by using inheritence
				
				flexibility through polymorphism
				
				easier to troubleshoot
				
				code maintainability and redability





Hoisting: memory is allocated to program excusion is  Hoisting

		  acessing function call before declartion of function


		    variable acessing before declaration is undefined in var let and const in not intialized
			
			
closures: is acessing function return values after excuting the function



Time Basec Events

setTimeout(): it excutes a code after  time expires


setTimeInterval(): it excutes a code repeatedly between time interval


clearInterval(): is used to clear the interval
